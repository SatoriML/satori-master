## Script Generation Guidelines

### Hook (0-5s)
**Must achieve ONE of:**
- Pattern interrupt ("Stop using ChatGPT for...")
- Shocking stat ("95% of people don't know...")
- Personal story opener ("I wasted 6 months...")
- Contrarian take ("Claude is NOT better at...")
- Direct value promise ("Save 10 hours/week with...")

**Hook checklist:**
- [ ] Works WITHOUT audio (text-first)
- [ ] Creates curiosity gap
- [ ] Promises clear value
- [ ] Specific (not generic)

### Build-up (5-25s)
- Set context quickly (10-15s max)
- One example or story
- Build tension toward revelation
- Keep moving (no fluff)

### Satori Moment (25-50s)
- The payoff / AHA moment
- Make it visual (show if possible)
- Concrete and specific
- Repeatable by viewer

### Takeaway + CTA (50-60s)
- ONE clear action
- ONE call-to-action
- Loop back to hook (create rewatch)

## Tone Guidelines - Joachim's Voice

**DO:**
✅ Direct and honest ("Here's what works...")
✅ Experience-based ("I've tested this with 50+ clients...")
✅ Specific numbers ("Saves 3.5 hours per week...")
✅ Practical over theoretical ("Do this, not that...")
✅ Admit limitations ("Claude isn't perfect at X...")

**DON'T:**
❌ Hype or exaggeration ("GAME CHANGER!!!")
❌ Clickbait without delivery
❌ Generic advice ("Just try AI...")
❌ Guru posturing ("I'm the best...")
❌ Tech jargon overload (explain simply)

**Style notes:**
- Short sentences (easier for captions)
- Active voice (more engaging)
- Second person ("You can..." not "One could...")
- Confident but humble
