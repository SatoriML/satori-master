# Satori Knowledge Base

- Start at `ops/index/README.md` for navigation, ownership, and quick links.
- Use `ops/index/manifest.json` for automated lookups (clients, web pages, generated channels).
- Keep workstreams tidy by archiving completed material under `archive/<Quarter>/`.
- Run `git status -sb` and `git diff --stat` before committing large structural changes.
