## Opportunity Analysis

### AI Maturity: ZERO
- Have NOT started working with AI yet
- Jennie said they "must" get started (high urgency)
- Perfect greenfield opportunity

### Pain Points (Identified)
1. **Risk Management & Compliance**
   - AI Act enforcement February 2025 (urgent)
   - Manual risk analysis across 5,000 clients
   - Need for fraud/suspicious activity detection

2. **Financial/Economic Processes**
   - 80% of processes can be automated (industry standard)
   - Time-consuming reporting, reconciliation, documentation
   - Jennie spending 65-70% time on repetitive tasks

3. **Scalability Constraints**
   - 30 employees managing 6.9B + 5,000 clients
   - Recent expansion (Luleå office) increasing complexity
   - Growth limited by manual processes

### Value Proposition for Placerum
- **Immediate**: Free up 65-70% of Jennie's time from routine tasks
- **Short-term**: AI Act compliance readiness (Feb 2025 deadline)
- **Medium-term**: 30-40% efficiency gains across organization
- **Long-term**: Competitive differentiation as "tech-forward" regional leader

### Estimated ROI
- Conservative: 385% over 12 months (Jennie + 2 advisors)
- Aggressive: 1,200% over 12 months (all 30 employees)
- Time to value: 3 months for first wins

- ✅ **No existing AI partner**: Confirmed - zero AI usage
- ✅ **Curiosity for generative AI**: High - "must get started"

## Recommended Solution

### Primary: satori-uppstart (6 months)
**Why**:
- Perfect for zero-to-AI journey
- 30 employees = right size for hands-on training
- Jennie can be internal champion with guided support
- Workshop-based approach fits their consultative culture

**Focus Areas**:
1. Risk management automation (AI Act compliance)
2. Financial reporting & reconciliation
3. Client portfolio review prep
4. Knowledge base/internal Q&A assistant
5. Invoice/expense automation

**Investment**: ~300,000 SEK (6 months)
**Expected ROI**: 250-400% Year 1

### Secondary: satori-chat (if they grow)
- Revisit when they reach 50-100+ employees
- Or if they want scalable solution immediately
- Could be phase 2 after satori-uppstart success

## Competitive Intelligence

### Their Competitors Using AI
- SEB (strong digitalization focus)
- Länsförsäkringar (AI research projects)
- Other asset managers adopting AI rapidly

### Our Competitive Advantage
- Specialized in zero-to-AI journeys
- Swedish market expertise
- Workshop + implementation (not just tech)
- Regional presence understanding (northern Sweden)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks
- **Low urgency**: Despite "must get started" comment, no concrete deadline (except AI Act)
- **Budget constraints**: Smaller org, may prioritize other investments
- **Decision complexity**: 30 employees but may need broad buy-in
- **Technical readiness**: Unknown IT infrastructure/systems compatibility

### Mitigation
- Emphasize AI Act urgency (Feb 2025 = 4 months)
- Show ROI in Jennie's time first (quick win)
- Involve Anders early for executive sponsorship
- Offer low-risk pilot/workshop to prove value

---

## Pipeline Forecast

**Best Case**:
- Agreement to satori-uppstart 6 months by December 2025
- Start January 2026
- Value: 300,000 SEK
- Close probability: 60%

**Most Likely**:
- Workshop in November 2025
- Proposal/decision in December
- Start February 2026 (after AI Act kicks in, creates urgency)
- Value: 300,000 SEK
- Close probability: 40%

**Worst Case**:
- Long decision process (committee)
- Budget allocated for 2026 planning
- Start Q2 2026 or later
- Close probability: 20%

**Expected Value**: 300,000 × 40% = 120,000 SEK (weighted)
