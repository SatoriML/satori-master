**Tagline:** "60 seconds to your next AI breakthrough"

## Core Concept

60-second videos delivering one powerful AI insight per episode. Focus on Claude and AI tools exploration. Each video builds to a "Satori Moment" - that AHA breakthrough when something clicks.

Format: Hook → Insight → Practical Takeaway

---

## 60-Second Structure

```
[0-5s]   HOOK - Pattern interrupt, surprising statement
[5-50s]  THE INSIGHT - Build up to the "Satori Moment"
[50-60s] TAKEAWAY + CTA - One action, one call-to-action
```

**Key principles:**
- First 3 seconds = everything (retention)
- One idea per video (no cramming)
- Show, don't tell (screen recordings when possible)
- End with open loop ("Part 2 coming...")
