# Website Content Map

- `pages/` – primary site copy (hero, services, policies, product explainers).
- `blog/articles/` – long-form posts prepared for publishing.
- `blog/source-material/` – research, transcripts, and drafts feeding future posts.

Keep filenames kebab-case and prepend `YYYY-MM-DD_` only when articles are time-sensitive. Move retired pages to `archive/<Quarter>/` after deployment.
