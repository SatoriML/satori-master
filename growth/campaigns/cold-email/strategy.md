I run a B2B SaaS and have been struggling with increased CPMs lately. Thats why we resorted to cold emailing, starting in Feb. We have profitabily scaled it to some nice numbers (1500 emails daily, 3% reply rate, 27% close rate,..) so its becoming one of our most important acquisition channels.

I knew nothing about cold emailing before I started. Along the way I learned a thing or two (or at least I think I did), so I am sharing the learnings here:

Part 1: Technical Setup
Domain Strategy

Buy separate domains just for email campaigns (dont use main one)

Set up DNS records immediately: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

Use Google workspace or Microsoft 365 for better delivery (costs cca $4 /account /mo)

Email Account Setup

Create 1-3 email accounts per domain

Start sending 10 emails per account daily, then increase by 10% each day

Maximum: 25 emails per account per day once warmed up

Example: 4 domains × 3 accounts each × 25 emails = 300 emails daily

Warm up Process

Warm up accounts for at least 14 days

Also helps:

Add real profile photos to accounts

Forward your sending domains to your main website

Use older domains when possible - they perform better

Set up custom tracking domains for tracking open rates (like track.yourdomain.com)

------------------------------------------------------

Part 2: Finding the right people
1. LinkedIn-Based Data (Best for Office Workers)

Perfect for: Software companies, consultants, law firms, marketing agencies

Top Tools:

Apollo io - Most complete LinkedIn database

LinkedIn Sales Navigator + data enrichment tools

Crunchbase - Great for startups and tech companies

PitchBook - Investor and funding data

2. Google Maps Data (Best for Local Businesses)

Perfect for: Restaurants, repair shops, medical offices, retail stores

Top Tools:

Outscraper - Specialized Google Maps scraper

Clay's Google Maps feature

Serper dev

3. Finding Similar Companies

When you have a specific successful customer type:

Tools:

Pandamatch - Budget-friendly option

Ocean - More expensive but cleaner interface

Other Useful Tools

Instant Data Scraper - Browser extension

BuiltWith - See what technology companies use

Clay - Fill in missing contact information

------------------------------------------------------

Part 3: Cleaning Your Email List
This step is CRUICAL. Bad email addresses will:

Make your emails bounce back

Trigger spam filters

Hurt your sender reputation

Waste your daily sending limit

Recommended Services:

MillionVerifier com - Good value

VerifyEmailAI com - Extremely good value

Listmint io - More expensive but handles tricky email types

------------------------------------------------------

Part 4: Organizing Your Contacts
Group your contacts into specific segments so you can write targeted messages. Good segmentation beats generic AI personalization.

Ways to Group Contacts:

Industry niches: Target specific types within broader industries

Upcoming events: Reference trade shows or conferences they might attend

Success stories: Group by which case study would appeal to them most

Location: City, state, or region-based targeting

Job level: Decision makers vs. influencers

Problems: Group by their biggest likely challenges

------------------------------------------------------

Part 5: Writing Effective Emails
Email Format Rules

Plain text only (no fancy formatting)

Use spintax for greetings and sign-offs to add variety

No images or tables

Simple signature with no links or photos

Test every email template with 50-100 sends first

The 4-Part Email Structure:

1. Personal Reason (Why This Person?)

Explain why you're contacting them specifically.

Example: "Hi Sarah, I saw your marketing agency's recent blog post about client retention challenges, and it got me thinking about your situation."

2. What You Offer (Value Proposition)

Clearly state what you do and how it helps.

Example: "We help marketing agencies like yours reduce client churn by 40% through our automated client health monitoring system. We've worked with 75+ agencies in the past two years."

3. Simple Next Step (Call to Action)

Make it easy to say yes with a clear, simple request.

Example: "Would you be interested in a 15-minute call to see how this could work for your agency?"

Best CTAs either:

Offer something free and valuable (audit, trial, consultation)

Ask a simple yes/no question

4. Proof (Handle Objections)

Address doubts with specific examples and results.

Example: "Last month, we helped Digital Growth Co. reduce their client churn from 15% to 6% in just 30 days using our system."

Subject Line Tips

Keep subject lines short and curious (6 words or less):

"Question for {{first_name}}?"

"{{first_name}} - quick thought?"

"{{company_name}} marketing?"

"Noticed {{company_name}}"

------------------------------------------------------

Part 6: Writing Best Practices
Keep It Human

Short emails: People won't read long messages from strangers

Personal feel: Make it seem like you spent time on each email

Truthful claims: Say "we've helped 50+ companies" instead of "we're the best"

Clear language: Don't make people guess what you're selling

Industry language: Use terms they recognize from their field

------------------------------------------------------

Part 7: Follow-Up Strategy
Follow-up emails are simpler than first emails. You're just:

Adding more context

Reminding them of your offer

Presenting the same offer differently

Follow-Up Rules:

Send 2-4 follow-ups maximum

Space them 2-14 days apart

Make timing feel natural (not robotic)

Focus on new prospects rather than endless follow-ups

------------------------------------------------------

Part 8: Testing and Optimization
Before Launching:

Test email spam score at mail-tester com

Send small test batches (50-100 emails)

Monitor reply rates and deliverability

Adjust based on results

Success Metrics:

Reply rate: 2-5% is good

Positive reply rate: 1-2% is solid

Meeting booking rate: 0.5-1% is excellent

Close rate: 20-30% of meetings is strong

Getting Started Checklist
Buy 2-3 domains for outreach

Set up DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

Create email accounts and warm them up

Choose your data source and build contact list

Validate all email addresses

Segment contacts into targeted groups

Write and test your first email template

Start with small test batches

Scale up based on results
